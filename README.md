# aws-project

Want to explore the workflow of multiple AWS services, and want to get hands-on with the console as well? Taking some inspiration from tiny technical tutorials on youtube, I built a basic web app with AWS services: Amplify, Lambda Serverless, DynamoDB, API Gatewayand AWS IAM and connected all of them. Docs are coming soon.
